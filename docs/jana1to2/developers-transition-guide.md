# Developers Transition Guide

***Key Syntax Changes between JANA1 to JANA2***

This guide outlines the critical syntax and functional updates between JANA1 and JANA2, helping developers navigate the transition smoothly.



## Namespace
##### **JANA1**
Adding following on top of all files was necessary in JANA1:

```
using namespace jana;
```
##### **JANA2**
This line is no longer required in JANA2.


## Application

### JApplication
#### Getting the JApplication

##### **JANA1**
In JANA1 there is a global variable `japp` which is a pointer to the project's `JApplication`. You can also obtain it from `JEventLoop::GetJApplication()`.

##### **JANA2**
In JANA2, `japp` is still around but we are strongly discouraging its future use. If you are within any JANA component (for instance: JFactory, JEventProcessor, JEventSource, JService) you can obtain the `JApplication` pointer from `this`, like so:

```cpp
auto app = GetApplication();
```

You can also obtain it from the `JEvent` the same way as you used to from `JEventLoop`, i.e. 

```cpp
auto app = event->GetJApplication();
```

### DApplication
### Getting DApplication
##### **JANA1**

```cpp
#include "DANA/DApplication.h"
dApplication = dynamic_cast<DApplication*>(locEventLoop->GetJApplication
```

##### **JANA2**
There is no `DApplication` anymore in JANA2. `JApplication` is `final`, which means you can't inherit from it. The functionality on `DApplication` has been moved into `JService`s, which can be accessed via `JApplication::GetService<ServiceT>()`. 

```cpp
auto dapp = GetApplication()->GetService<DApplication>();
```


## Parameter Manager
### Setting Parameters

##### **JANA1**

```cpp
gPARMS->SetDefaultParameter("component_prefix:value_name", ref_to_member_var);
```

##### **JANA2**
You should set parameters as shown below. 

```cpp
auto app = GetApplication();
app->SetDefaultParameter("component_prefix:value_name", ref_to_member_var);
```

We strongly recommend you register all parameters from inside the `Init()` callbacks of your JANA components, or from `InitPlugin()`. This helps JANA:

- Report back which parameters are available without having to process an input file.
- Emit a warning (or error!) when a user-provided parameter is misspelled
- Emit a warning when two plugins register the same parameter with conflicting default values.
- Inspect the exact parameter values used by a factory

If you register parameters in other contexts, this machinery might not work and you might get incomplete parameter lists and missing or spurious error messages. Worse, your code might not see the parameter values you expect it to see. Registering parameters from inside constructors is less problematic but still discouraged because it won't work with some upcoming new features.

### Getting Parameters

##### **JANA1**

```cpp
gPARMS->GetParameter("component_prefix:value_name", ref_to_member_var);
```

##### **JANA2**
```cpp
auto app = GetApplication();
// Method 1
app->GetParameter("component_prefix:value_name", member_var);
// Method 2
member_var = app->GetParameterValue<value_type>("component_prefix:value_name");
```


### Getting Parameter Maps

##### **JANA1**
To obtain a map of all parameters that share a common prefix:

```cpp
//gets all parameters with this filter at the beginning of the key
gPARMS->GetParameters(locParameterMap, "COMBO_DEDXCUT:"); 
```

##### **JANA2**
In JANA2 this has been renamed to `FilterParameters` but the functionality is the same.
Note that this method is not on `JApplication` directly; you have to obtain the parameter manager like so:

```cpp
//gets all parameters with this filter at the beginning of the key
GetApplication()->GetJParameterManager()->FilterParameters(locParameterMap, "COMBO_DEDXCUT:");
```


## DGeometry
#### Getting DGeometry

##### **JANA1**
###### Using japp
```cpp
#include "DANA/DApplication.h"
#include "HDGEOMETRY/DGeometry.h"

DApplication* dapp=dynamic_cast<DApplication*>(japp);
const DGeometry *dgeom = dapp->GetDGeometry(runnumber);
```

###### Using eventLoop

```cpp
#include "DANA/DApplication.h"
#include "HDGEOMETRY/DGeometry.h"

DGeometry *locGeom = dApplication ? dApplication->GetDGeometry(eventLoop->GetJEvent().GetRunNumber()) : NULL;
```

##### **JANA2**
In JANA2, you obtain the `DGeometryManager` from the `JApplication` and from there you use the run number to obtain the corresponding `DGeometry`:

```cpp
#include "HDGEOMETRY/DGeometry.h"

auto runnumber = event->GetRunNumber();
auto app = event->GetJApplication();
auto geo_manager = app->GetService<DGeometryManager>();
auto geom = geo_manager->GetDGeometry(runnumber);
```

To reduce the boilerplate, we've provided a handy helper function, `DEvent::GetDGeometry()`, that does all of these steps for you:

```cpp
#include "DANA/DEvent.h"

DGeometry *locGeometry = DEvent::GetDGeometry(locEvent);
```

You should call `GetDGeometry` from `JFactory::BeginRun` or `JEventProcessor::BeginRun`.


## Calibration
#### Accessing Calibration Data - `GetCalib` 
##### **JANA1**

```cpp
locEventLoop->GetCalib(locTOFParmsTable.c_str(), tofparms);
```

##### **JANA2**
Analogously to `DGeometry`, you obtain the calibrations by obtaining the `JCalibrationManager` from `JApplication::GetService<>()` and then loading the calibration object corresponding to the event's run number. We recommend you use `DEvent::GetCalib` to avoid this boilerplate. You should call this from your `BeginRun` callback. 

```cpp
#include "DANA/DEvent.h"

DEvent::GetCalib(event, locTOFParmsTable.c_str(), tofparms);
```

In principle, the calibrations could also be keyed off of event number intervals, in which case you should call it from `Process` and pass the event number as well:

```cpp
#include <JANA/JEvent.h>
#include <JANA/Calibrations/JCalibrationManager.h>

auto event_number = event->GetEventNumber();
auto run_number = event->GetRunNumber();

auto app = GetApplication();
auto calibration = app->GetService<JCalibrationManager>()->GetJCalibration(run_number);
calibration->Get("BCAL/mc_parms", bcalparms, event_number)
```


## Status Bit
#### Accessing Status Bit - `GetStatusBit`

##### **JANA1**

```cpp
locEventLoop->GetJEvent().GetStatusBit(kSTATUS_PHYSICS_EVENT)
```

##### **JANA2**
Status bits are no longer an event member variable. Instead, they are inserted and retrieved just like the other collections:

```cpp
#include "DANA/DStatusBits.h"


locEvent->GetSingle<DStatusBits>()->GetStatusBit(kSTATUS_PHYSICS_EVENT)

// or, for a little bit more safety:

locEvent->GetSingleStrict<DStatusBits>()->GetStatusBit(kSTATUS_REST);
```


## Magnetic Field
#### Getting Magnetic Field - `GetBField`

##### **JANA1**

```cpp
#include "DANA/DApplication.h"

dApplication = dynamic_cast<DApplication*>(locEventLoop->GetJApplication());
dMagFMap= dApplication->GetBfield(locEventLoop->GetJEvent().GetRunNumber());

```
##### **JANA2**
In JANA2, the magnetic field map is a resource handled analogously to `DGeometry` and `JCalibrationManager`. Thus, we recommend obtaining the 
field map by calling `DEvent::GetBField(event)` from inside `BeginRun`:

```cpp
#include "DANA/DEvent.h"

dMagneticFieldMap = DEvent::GetBfield(locEvent);
```


## Get Functions
### JObject Getters

#### 1. `GetSingleT`

`GetSingleT` has been replaced with `GetSingle`. Templated methods no longer have a `T` suffix; templated classes (such as `JFactoryT`) still do.
The new `GetSingle` returns a pointer rather than updating an out parameter. If there isn't exactly one associated item of that type, it will return 
`nullptr`.

##### **JANA1**

Was present in JANA1


##### **JANA2**

No longer available in JANA2; use ```GetSingle()``` instead


#### 2. `GetSingle`
##### **JANA1**

```cpp
// Pass by reference
// Set passed param equal to pointer to object
const Df250PulsePedestal* PPobj = NULL;
digihit->GetSingle(PPobj);
```

##### **JANA2**
```cpp
// Template function
// Return pointer to object
auto PPobj = digihit->GetSingle<Df250PulsePedestal>();
```


#### 3. `Get`

Similarly to `GetSingle`, `Get` returns a vector rather than updating an out parameter.
##### **JANA1**

```cpp
// Pass by Reference
vector<const DBCALUnifiedHit*> assoc_hits;
point.Get(assoc_hits);
```

##### **JANA2**
```cpp
// Templated Function
// Return value
vector<const DBCALUnifiedHit*> assoc_hits = point.Get<DBCALUnifiedHit>();
```
### JEvent Getters


#### 1. `GetSingle`
##### **JANA1**

```cpp
// Pass by Reference, 
// passed param got assigned pointer to object

const DTTabUtilities* locTTabUtilities = NULL;
loop->GetSingle(locTTabUtilities); 
```

##### **JANA2**
```cpp
// Return the pointer to object based on template type

const DTTabUtilities* locTTabUtilities = event->GetSingle<DTTabUtilities>();
```

#### 2. `Get`
##### **JANA1**

```cpp
// Pass by Reference
vector<const DBCALShower*> showers;
loop->Get(showers, "IU");
```

##### **JANA2**
```cpp
// JANA1 Get is still available but will be deprecated soon
// So better to use the one given below

// Templated function
// Return value
auto showers = event->Get<DBCALShower>("IU");
```

## **JEventSource**
### Key Differences
#### **1. Type name and Resource name

JEventSources are identified by both a type name, e.g. "JEventSource_EVIO", and a resource name, e.g. "./hd_rawdata_123456_000.evio". JANA2 handles both of these differently than JANA1.

In JANA1, the user was required to provide the type name manually by providing two callbacks:
```c++
virtual const char* className();
static const char* static_className();
```

In JANA2, the class name is simply a member variable on the `JEventSource` base class, which the user may access via getters and setters:
```c++
void SetTypeName(std::string type_name);
std::string GetTypeName() const;
```
Note that `JEventSourceGeneratorT` will automatically populate the type name. If a custom generator is being used, or no generator is used at all (e.g. for test cases), `SetTypeName()` should be called from inside the `JEventSource` constructor, just like with the other components.

The resource name has similarly evolved.
In JANA1, the resource name was always passed as a constructor argument and later accessed using `inline const char* GetSourceName()`. In JANA2, the resource name is a member variable accessed by `SetResourceName(std::string)` and `std::string GetResourceName() const`. While JANA2 still optionally accepts the resource name as a constructor argument for backwards compatibility, this is no longer preferred and will eventually be deprecated in favor of having `JEventSources` be default-constructible. `JEventSourceGeneratorT` already supports both constructor styles, and will automatically populate the resource name just like the type name, so the user shouldn't need to manually call `SetResourceName()`.


#### **2. Event Retrieval (`GetEvent` & `Emit`)**

In JANA1, populating and emitting a fresh event into the stream was done using `GetEvent`, which returned a `jerror_t` code to indicate success or failure. 

In JANA2, `jerror_t` has been removed completely, and the `GetEvent` callback has been replaced. JANA2 supports two new callback signatures, with different error-handling approaches. JANA2 will choose which callback to use based off the `callbackStyle` flag. For JEventSources, the available callback styles are `ExpertMode` and `LegacyMode`.
The purpose of the callback style flag is to enable smooth, gradual migrations in the future: components can opt-in to using new features on their own timetable without
having to update everything everywhere.

1. **`JEventSource::Result Emit(JEvent &event)`** – This is the preferred replacement for `GetEvent()`. It returns a `Result` enum with the following values: `Success` (indicating that a fresh event was successfully read), `FailureTryAgain` (indicating that no event was found, but more may be coming later), or `FailureFinished` (indicating that the file has or stream has run out of events and is ready to close). To tell JANA2 to use `Emit`, set the callback style to `ExpertMode` by calling `SetCallbackStyle(CallbackStyle::ExpertMode)` in the constructor.

2. `GetEvent(std::shared_ptr<JEvent> event)` – This callback signature will be deprecated in the near future, and so should not be used for new code. However, we are including it here for completeness. This method returns `void` and signals different statuses by throwing exceptions instead of returning an error code. It throws a `RETURN_STATUS` enum value, which includes `kNO_MORE_EVENTS`, `kBUSY`, `kTRY_AGAIN`, `kERROR`, or `kUNKNOWN`. This callback will be called by default, or if you set `SetCallbackStyle(CallbackStyle::LegacyMode)` in the `JEventSource` constructor.

| **Aspect**               | **JANA1**                                                                                                | **JANA2**                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`GetEvent`**           | `GetEvent(JEvent &event)` returns a `jerror_t` error code (e.g., `NOERROR`, `NO_MORE_EVENTS_IN_SOURCE`). | `GetEvent(std::shared_ptr<JEvent> event)` returns `void` and signals different statuses by throwing `RETURN_STATUS` enum values as exceptions.                 |
| **Recommended - `Emit`** | _Not available._                                                                                         | `Emit(JEvent &event)` provides an alternative way to retrieve events. Instead of throwing an exception, it returns one of `Result` enum values to show status. |

#### **3. `GetObjects` Implementation**
JANA1’s `GetObjects` returned a `jerror_t`.  
JANA2 replaces this with a `bool` return type. Never return a `jerror_t`, as the compiler may mistakenly perceive it as `true` when the intended meaning is `false`. Always return `true` if objects are found and `false` otherwise.

| **Aspect**                    | **JANA1**                                                                 | **JANA2**                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GetObjects Implementation** | `jerror_t GetObjects(jana::JEvent &event, jana::JFactory_base *factory);` | `bool GetObjects(const std::shared_ptr<const JEvent> &event, JFactory* factory) override;` `bool` (return `true` if objects found, otherwise `false`). |

#### **4. Enabling `GetObjects` Call**
In **JANA1**, `GetObjects` was always called, leading to unnecessary performance overhead.  
In **JANA2**, `GetObjects` is **disabled by default**. If the source file contains objects that should be used instead of being generated by factories, enable it in the event source constructor:

```cpp
EnableGetObjects(true);
```

|**Aspect**|**JANA1**|**JANA2**|
|---|---|---|
|**Enabling `GetObjects` Call**|Called by default for every event.|Disabled by default. Must be enabled with `EnableGetObjects(true)`.|

#### **5. Calling `FinishEvent`**
In **JANA1**, `FreeEvent` was always called automatically after an event was processed, but this required acquiring/releasing locks, adding performance overhead. In **JANA2**, `FinishEvent` replaces `FreeEvent` and is **disabled by default** for efficiency. If additional logic should run at the end of each event, enable it manually in the event source constructor:

```cpp
EnableFinishEvent(true);
```

|**Aspect**|**JANA1**|**JANA2**|
|---|---|---|
|**Calling `FinishEvent`**|`FreeEvent` was always called automatically.|`FinishEvent` is disabled by default to improve performance.|

#### 6. Resource lifetimes (`Open()` and `Close()`)

In **JANA1**, the initialization of parameters and opening of the file or socket was done inside the constructor, and the closing of the file or socket was done inside the destructor. In **JANA2**, the lifecycle is **explicitly managed** using the `Init()`, `Open()` and `Close()` callbacks:

| **Aspect**           | **JANA1**                   | **JANA2**                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initialization**   | Handled in the constructor. | `Init()` should be used for obtaining parameters and services. |
| **Opening a Source** | Handled in the constructor. | `Open()` is called when JANA is ready to accept events from the event source |
| **Closing a Source** | Handled in the destructor.  | `Close()` is called when the source is done processing events.               |

These methods allow better resource management by ensuring that the event source is properly opened before processing events and properly cleaned up afterwards.

##### **Example Usage in JANA2**
```cpp
void JEventSource_Sample::Open() {
// Initialize resources (e.g., open files, set up connections)
}

void JEventSource_Sample::Close() {
 // Release resources (e.g., close files, disconnect)
}
```


### **JEventSource Header Files**
##### **JANA1**

#ifndef _JEventSource_Sample_
#define _JEventSource_Sample_

};
```

## JEventProcessor
### JEventProcessor Header File

`JEventProcessors` in JANA2 have a similar feel to JANA1. The key differences are:

1. The names and type signatures of the callbacks have changed
2. The event number and run number now live on the JEvent object rather than as separate arguments
3. JANA2 doesn't use `jerror_t` anywhere for several reasons: there's too many options to exhaustively check, most 
error codes don't apply to JEventProcessors, there's no clear indication which error codes represent failure conditions,
and no reasonable strategy JANA can take if a failure is reached other than a premature exit. Thus the callbacks return
void. 
4. If a failure condition is reached in user code, the user should throw a `JException` with a detailed message. JANA will
add additional context information (such as the component name, callback, plugin, and backtrace), log everything, and shut
down cleanly.
5. The user no longer provides a `className` callback. Instead, they call `SetTypeName(NAME_OF_THIS);` from the constructor.

##### JANA1

```cpp
#ifndef _JEventProcessor_myplugin_
#define _JEventProcessor_myplugin_

#include <JANA/JApplication.h>
#include <JANA/JFactory.h>
#include <JANA/JEventProcessor.h>
using namespace jana;
  

class JEventProcessor_myplugin : public jana::JEventProcessor{
public:
	JEventProcessor_myplugin();
	~JEventProcessor_myplugin();
	const char* className(void){return "JEventProcessor_myplugin";}

private:
	jerror_t init(void); 
	jerror_t brun(jana::JEventLoop *eventLoop, int32_t runnumber); 
	jerror_t evnt(jana::JEventLoop *eventLoop, uint64_t eventnumber); 
	jerror_t erun(void); 
	jerror_t fini(void); 

};

#endif // _JEventProcessor_myplugin_
```

##### JANA2

```cpp
#ifndef _JEventProcessor_myplugin_
#define _JEventProcessor_myplugin_
#include <JANA/JEventProcessor.h>

class JEventProcessor_myplugin : public JEventProcessor {

public:
	JEventProcessor_myplugin() { 
        SetTypeName(NAME_OF_THIS);
    }
	~JEventProcessor_myplugin() = default;

private:
	void Init() override;
	void BeginRun(const std::shared_ptr<const JEvent>& event) override; 
	void Process(const std::shared_ptr<const JEvent>& event) override; 
	void EndRun() override; 
	void Finish() override; 
};

#endif // _JEventProcessor_myplugin_
```

## JObject
### JObject Header File


`JObjects` in JANA2 are also conceptually similar to their JANA1 counterparts, with a
syntax refresh aimed at future extensibility. The `toStrings` callback has been
replaced with a `Summarize` callback as shown below. Note that in JANA2, data model classes
do not need to inherit from `JObject` anymore - `JObject` merely provides clean, user-specified formatting, 
and convenient simple tracking of object associations. JANA2 also supports using [PODIO](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio)
based data models, which provide free serialization/deserialization, a first-class Python interface, automatic
memory management and immutability guarantees, and relational object associations.

##### JANA1
```cpp
#include <JANA/JObject.h>
#include <JANA/JFactory.h>

using namespace jana;

class DCereHit: public JObject {
public:

    JOBJECT_PUBLIC(DCereHit);
    int sector; 
    float pe; 
    float t;

    void toStrings(vector<pair<string, string> >&items) const { 
        AddString(items, "sector", "%d", sector);
        AddString(items, "pe", "%1.3f", pe);
        AddString(items, "t", "%1.3f", t);
    }
};
```

##### JANA2

```cpp
#include <JANA/JObject.h>

class DCereHit: public JObject {
public:

    JOBJECT_PUBLIC(DCereHit);
    int sector;
    float pe;
    float t;

    void Summarize(JObjectSummary& summary) const override {
        summary.add(sector, "sector", "%d");
        summary.add(pe, "pe", "%1.3f");
        summary.add(t, "t", "%1.3f");
    }
};
```
### JObject ID Handling

In JANA1, JObjects provided an `id` field. However it was left up to the user how to set and use it. Because JANA can't guarantee
that it is set reliably or consistently, it is fundamentally part of the data model and not part of the framework. Thus, JANA2 
no longer provides a built-in object id. If needed, users are welcome to add their own `id` field to their data model classes and
establish a convention for how and when it gets set. For reliable, automatic object IDs for all data model classes, consider using PODIO.


##### **JANA1**
```cpp
// JANA1 JObject had a data member id

DBCALShower *shower = new DBCALShower;
shower->id = id++;
```
##### **JANA2**

```cpp
// id data member does not exist in JObject anymore in JANA2

DBCALShower *shower = new DBCALShower;
shower->id = id++; // Compiler error
```

Similarly, the `JObject::oid_t` type has been removed from JANA2 as well. If you need it, it lives on in the halld_recon codebase:

```cpp
#include "DANA/DObjectID.h"

oid_t // Not inside JObject anymore!
```

## JFactory
### Transition from JFactory to JFactoryT
##### **JANA1**
In JANA1, `JFactory_base` was a common factory base class, and `JFactory` was a template that inherits from `JFactory_base` and adds functionality specific to the type of the factory's output collection.
##### **JANA2**
In JANA2, the base class was renamed to `JFactory`, and the template was renamed to `JFactoryT`. JANA2 adds some new functionality, but the old functionality is largely consistent with JANA1. 

The syntax differences between JANA1 and JANA2 `JFactory`s' are consistent with those for `JEventProcessor`s. 

1. The names and type signatures of the callbacks have changed
2. The event number and run number now live on the JEvent object rather than as separate arguments
3. JANA2 doesn't use `jerror_t` anywhere for several reasons: there's too many options to exhaustively check, most 
error codes don't apply to JEventProcessors, there's no clear indication which error codes represent failure conditions,
and no reasonable strategy JANA can take if a failure is reached other than a premature exit. Thus the callbacks return
void. 
4. If a failure condition is reached in user code, the user should throw a `JException` with a detailed message. JANA will
add additional context information (such as the component name, callback, plugin, and backtrace), log everything, and shut
down cleanly.
5. The user no longer provides a `className` callback. Instead, they call `SetTypeName(NAME_OF_THIS);` from the constructor.

Another important difference is how factory tags are set. In JANA1, the user provides a `Tag()` callback, whereas in JANA2,
the user sets the tag by calling `SetTag()` from the constructor. The user can retrieve the factory tag by calling `GetTag()`.

One important semantic difference is that in JANA1, there is always one factory set assigned to each thread, whereas in JANA2, 
there is one factory set for each event in flight. The number of in-flight events is a parameter controlled separately 
from the thread count. This is important for ensuring that there is always work for threads to do when running 
multi-level processing topologies. Another consequence of this design is that factories don't belong to just one thread and hence 
shouldn't reference thread-local variables - instead, one thread can pop an event from a queue, process it, and push it to a 
different queue, where it could later be picked up by a different thread. Importantly, however, only one thread has access to any 
given JEvent and its corresponding factory set at any time, so you don't need to worry about thread safety in JFactories.

### Factory Header File

##### JANA1

```cpp
#ifndef _myfactory_factory_
#define _myfactory_factory_

#include <JANA/JFactory.h>
#include "myobject.h"

class myfactory_factory : public jana::JFactory<myobject> {

public:
    myfactory_factory() = default;
    ~myfactory_factory() = default;

    const char* Tag() { return "MyTag"; }

private:
    jerror_t init(void); 
    jerror_t brun(jana::JEventLoop *eventLoop, int32_t runnumber); 
    jerror_t evnt(jana::JEventLoop *eventLoop, uint64_t eventnumber); 
    jerror_t erun(void); 
    jerror_t fini(void); 
};

#endif
```

##### JANA2

```cpp
#ifndef _thirdFacTest_factory_
#define _thirdFacTest_factory_

#include <JANA/JFactoryT.h>
#include "myobject.h"

class thirdFacTest_factory : public JFactoryT<myobject> {
public:
    thirdFacTest_factory() { 
        SetTag("MyTag");
    }
    ~thirdFacTest_factory() = default;

private:
    void Init() override;
    void BeginRun(const std::shared_ptr<const JEvent>& event) override; 
    void Process(const std::shared_ptr<const JEvent>& event) override; 
    void EndRun() override; 
    void Finish() override; 
};

#endif
```

### Registering a New Factory

In JANA1, the user creates a `JFactoryGenerator` with a `GenerateFactories()` callback. Within this callback, 
the user instantiates new factories and adds them to a `JEventLoop`. (In `halld_recon`, there is a `DFactoryGenerator`
which instantiates factories for all fundamental detector plugins, calling each plugin's corresponding 
`$DETECTOR_init()` function.)

In JANA2, the user is still free to create their own `JFactoryGenerator`. It's syntax has been modified (notably, 
`GenerateFactories()` provides a `JFactorySet` argument that the user adds the factories to), but the core concepts
are the same. However, there is now also a `JFactoryGeneratorT` utility which reduces the boilerplate. As long
as the factory is default constructible, the user merely needs to pass the factory class as a template argument to
`JFactoryGeneratorT`, and JANA will do the rest of the work. JANA2 is perfectly fine with users passing a single 
`JFactoryGenerator` that instantiates every single factory in the system, but there are future benefits if users
pass separate `JFactoryGeneratorT`s for each factory instead.


##### **JANA1**

```cpp
#include <JANA/JApplication.h>
#include "JFactoryGenerator_myfactory.h"
#include "myfactory.h"

using namespace jana;

extern "C" {
void InitPlugin(JApplication *app) {
	InitJANAPlugin(app);
	app->AddFactoryGenerator(new JFactoryGenerator_myfactory());
}
} // "C"
```

##### **JANA2**

```cpp
#include <JANA/JApplication.h>
#include <JANA/JFactoryGenerator.h>
#include "myfactory.h"

extern "C" {
void InitPlugin(JApplication *app) {
	InitJANAPlugin(app);
	app->Add(new JFactoryGeneratorT<my_factory>());
}
} // "C"
```

### Getting All Factories

Sometimes it is necessary to retrieve all factories that produce objects of a given type. In
JANA1 this was done by retrieving all factories and doing a `dynamic_cast`. In JANA2 there's a
dedicated method for this, `GetFactoryAll`. (Note that this will retrieve the factories without
automatically running them!). JANA2 also supports retrieving all objects of type `T` from all
factories using `GetAll()` and retrieving all objects descended from parent type `T` 
(e.g. `JObject` or `TObject`) using `GetAlllChildren()`.

##### **JANA1**

```cpp
vector<JFactory_base*> locFactories = locEventLoop->GetFactories();
// Cast JFactory_base to particular factory type
JFactory<DReaction>* locFactory = dynamic_cast<JFactory<DReaction>*>(locFactories[0]);
```

##### **JANA2**

```cpp
// Retrieve all factories producing T directly
vector<JFactoryT<DReaction>*> locFacs = locEvent->GetFactoryAll<DReaction>();
```

### Saving Created Object(s) to Factory

When writing a factory, the user creates some data objects inside `Process()` and
then needs to pass them back to JANA. In JANA1, this was done by modifying the
`_data` member variable directly. In JANA2, we prefer using a dedicated setter method.
For the sake of porting GlueX without having to rewrite certain complex factories, 
we've left the member variable `protected`, though the member variable has been 
renamed to `mData`.

##### _Single Object_
###### **JANA1**

```cpp
_data.push_back(locAnalysisResults);
```

###### **JANA2**

```cpp
Insert(locAnalysisResults);

// Or (less preferred)
mData.push_back(locAnalysisResults);
```

##### _Array of Objects_

```cpp
std::vector<Hit*> results;
results.push_back(new Hit(...));
```

###### **JANA1**

```cpp
for (auto hit: results){
	_data.push_back(hit); 
}
```

###### **JANA2**

```cpp
Set(results)
```

### **Setting Factory Flag**
In JANA1, factory flag was set by calling `SetFactoryFlag(FLAG_NAME)` inside the factory constructor. The available flags were:

```cpp
enum JFactory_Flags_t {
    JFACTORY_NULL      = 0x00,
    PERSISTANT         = 0x01,  // Misspelling of "PERSISTENT"
    WRITE_TO_OUTPUT    = 0x02,
    NOT_OBJECT_OWNER   = 0x04
};
```

JANA2 retains the same approach but introduces an additional flag while correcting the spelling of `PERSISTANT`:

```cpp
enum JFactory_Flags_t {
    JFACTORY_NULL     = 0x00,
    PERSISTENT        = 0x01,  // Corrected spelling
    WRITE_TO_OUTPUT   = 0x02,
    NOT_OBJECT_OWNER  = 0x04,
    REGENERATE        = 0x08   // New flag
};
```
#### **Key Differences**
##### **1. `REGENERATE` – Forcing the Factory to Regenerate Objects**
In JANA2, the `REGENERATE` flag prevents JANA from searching for objects in the input file, replicating the behavior of `use_factory = 1` in JANA1.
###### **JANA1:**
```cpp
DEventWriterROOT_factory_ReactionEfficiency() {
    use_factory = 1; 
};
```
 ###### **JANA2:**
```cpp
DEventWriterROOT_factory_ReactionEfficiency() {
    SetRegenerateFlag(REGENERATE);
};
```

Alternatively, you can enable the `REGENERATE` flag using a boolean value:

```cpp
DEventWriterROOT_factory_ReactionEfficiency() {
    SetRegenerateFlag(true);
};
```

##### **2. `PERSISTENT` – Making Factory-Generated Objects Persistent**
In JANA1, objects were made persistent by calling `SetFactoryFlag(PERSISTANT)`. JANA2 corrects the spelling mistake, renaming it to `PERSISTENT`, while maintaining the same core functionality. However, there is a key difference in how persistent objects are handled:
- **JANA1:** The destructors of persistent objects are called automatically when the process terminates.
- **JANA2:** The destructors of persistent objects are never called automatically, meaning any logic inside them will not execute unless the objects are explicitly deleted by the user. Therefore, if you set the `PERSISTENT` flag, you must manually delete these objects inside the factory’s `Finish()` method to prevent memory leaks.
&nbsp;
    ```cpp
    void Finish() {
        for (auto locInfo : mData) {
            delete locInfo;
        }
        mData.clear();
    }
    ```

## JEvent
### Transition from JEventLoop to JEvent
##### **JANA1**
In JANA1, all processing operated on a `JEventLoop` object. In JANA2, this has been changed to `JEvent`.
Conceptually, a `JEvent` is just a container for data that can be processed as a discrete unit, indepedently from the rest
of the stream (this usually correspondings to a physics event, but also potentially a timeslice, block, subevent, etc). This includes the 
event number, run number, all data read from the event source, all data created by factories so far, and all of
the factory state necessary to generate additional data belonging to the same context. The factories themselves are managed by a `JFactorySet`
which is one-to-one with and owned by the JEvent.

### Getting the Run Number
##### **JANA1**
```cpp
run_number = locEventLoop->GetJEvent().GetRunNumber());
```
##### **JANA2**
```cpp
locEvent->GetRunNumber()
```

#### Getting the Event Number
##### **JANA1**

```cpp
run_number = locEventLoop->GetJEvent().GetEventNumber());
```
##### **JANA2**

```cpp
locEvent->GetEventNumber()
```

## Acquiring Locks

JANA1 required the user to manually acquire and hold locks when accessing to shared resources in a JEventProcessor.
JANA2 offers a different interface which handles all locks internally. However, using this new callback interface
would require restructuring the existing `JEventProcessor` code. When migrating from JANA1 to JANA2 it 
is much safer to avoid making such deep changes, at least initially. The old-style user-managed locks can be migrated
to JANA2 as-is with one minor change: the various lock helper methods have been moved from `JApplication` to `JLockService`.


### ROOT Read/Write locks
##### JANA1

```cpp
dActionLock = japp->RootReadLock(); 
// ...
japp->RootUnLock(locLockName);
```
##### JANA2

```cpp
auto app = GetApplication(); // or event->GetJApplication()
auto lock_svc = app->GetService<JLockService>();

lock_svc->RootReadLock(); 
// ...
lock_svc->RootUnLock();
```

To reduce boilerplate, we've added a helper function:

```cpp
#include "DANA/DEvent.h"

DEvent::GetLockService(locEvent)->RootWriteLock(); 
DEvent::GetLockService(locEvent)->RootUnLock();
```

### Named locks

##### JANA1

```cpp
dActionLock = japp->ReadLock(locLockName); 
// ...
pthread_rwlock_unlock(dActionLock);
// Or: japp->Unlock(locLockName);
```

##### JANA2

```cpp
auto app = GetApplication(); // or event->GetJApplication()
auto lock_svc = app->GetService<JLockService>();

dActionLock = lock_svc->ReadLock(locLockName); 
// ...
pthread_rwlock_unlock(dActionLock);
// Or: lock_svc->Unlock(locLockName);
```

To reduce boilerplate:

```cpp
DEvent::GetLockService(locEvent)->ReadLock("app"); 
DEvent::GetLockService(locEvent)->Unlock("app");
```
## Deprecated Headers & Functions

### Why Do These Warnings Appear?
When building a plugin ported to JANA2, you may see deprecation warnings (deprecated headers etc.). These headers and functions exist in JANA2 only for backward compatibility with JANA1 and are marked as deprecated to discourage their use, as they may be removed in the future.

### Can These Warnings Be Ignored?
Yes, as long as your plugin compiles without crashes. They don't have any immediate impact on functionality. However, it’s better to update to the latest headers and functions because:
- Deprecated headers and functions may be removed completely in future JANA2 versions.
- Using them can slightly slow down compilation.
### How to Remove These Warnings?
Replace deprecated headers and functions in your plugin code with alternatives provided in following table:

| **Deprecated** | **Use Instead** |  
|--------------------------|---------------------------|  
| `#include <JANA/Compatibility/JLockService.h>` | `#include <JANA/Services/JLockService.h>` |  
| `#include <JANA/Compatibility/JGeometry.h>` | `#include <JANA/Geometry/JGeometry.h>` |  
| `#include <JANA/Calibrations/JLargeCalibration.h>` | `#include <JANA/Calibrations/JResource.h>` |  
| `auto *jlargecalib = DEvent::GetJLargeCalibration(event);` | `auto *res = DEvent::GetJResource(event);` |  
| `jlargecalib->GetResource(dedx_i_theta_file_name["file_name"]);` | `res->GetResource(dedx_i_theta_file_name["file_name"]);` |  
| `JLargeCalibration *jresman;` | `JResource *jresman;` |  
| `jresman = calib_svc->GetLargeCalibration(runnumber);` | `jresman = calib_svc->GetResource(runnumber);` |  
| `#include <JANA/Compatibility/JGeometryXML.h>` | `#include <JANA/Geometry/JGeometryXML.h>` |

## Rarely Used Features

### `Unknown` Handling

The enum in `particleType.h` was experiencing a name conflict with a JANA2 enum, so it has been changed
to an enum class.

##### **JANA1**

```cpp
//Was a plain enum so could be accessed without any scope resolution operator

#include "particleType.h"

return ((locFirstStep->Get_TargetPID() != Unknown) || (locFirstStep->Get_SecondBeamPID() != Unknown));
```

##### **JANA2**
```cpp
// Is Enum class now so could be accessed like this `Particle_t::Unknown` only

#include "particleType.h"

return ((locFirstStep->Get_TargetPID() != Particle_t::Unknown) || (locFirstStep->Get_SecondBeamPID() != Particle_t::Unknown));
```
