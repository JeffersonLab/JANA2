This website provides documentation for JANA2 C++ API automatically generated by Doxygen. 

## Main API

* [JApplication](class_j_application.html): The main entry point into the program
* [JObject](class_j_object.html): Data containers for specific results
* [JEventSource](class_j_event_source.html): From a file or messaging producer, expose a stream of events. Each event is an aggregate of JObjects
* [JFactory](class_j_factory.html): Given an event, calculate a specific result, potentially calling other JFactories recursively to obtain any prereqs
* [JEventProcessor](class_j_event_processor.html): Run desired JFactories over the event stream, writing results to an output file or messaging consumer

## User-facing utilities

* [JParameter](class_j_parameter.html): Configure the behavior of components at runtime
* [JLogger](struct_j_logger.html): Publish debugging information to standard out in a structured, convenient, threadsafe way
* [JService](struct_j_service.html): Share external (stateful) services such as calibration constants and magnetic field maps

## Internal services

* [JParameterManager](class_j_parameter_manager.html): Furnish the user with parameters extracted from command line flags and configuration files

* [JExecutionEngine](class_j_execution_engine.html): Runs the topology. Manages the thread team and the topology status.
