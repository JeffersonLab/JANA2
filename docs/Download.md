### 2.4.3

#### Behavior changes

- JHasOutputs represents variadic output names as `std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>`, which now allows for multiple variadic outputs with arbitrary lengths (Pull request #458)

- Removed the never-used JEventProcessorSequential and JEventProcessorSequentialRoot. All their functionality has been backported to JEventProcessor. (Pull request #456)

- JInspector is now launched using the parameter `jana:inspect=true` instead of the command-line argument `--interactive`, which works regardless of which executable runs JANA. (Pull request 459)

#### Bugfixes

- Relax JFactory::Create cycle detector for the sake of JEventSourceEVIOpp (Pull request #461)

- Fix JFactoryPodioT template error when using Podio LinkCollections (Pull request #462)

- JEventUnfolder erroneously inserted outputs even though KeepChildNextParent was returned (Pull request #458)

- JEventUnfolder supports parent events with zero children (Pull request #456)

- JTopologyBuilder creates a chain of TapArrows so that independent JEventProcessors can be pipelined, allowing new-style JEventProcessors to have comparable performance to the old-style ones. (Pull request 456)

#### Features

- Variadic inputs now support an EmptyInputPolicy, which allows components to optionally retrieve all databundles/collections for a given type and EventLevel, analogous to JEvent::GetFactoryAll(). (Pull request #454)

#### Usability improvements and refactoring

- Improve the JANA tutorial and examples by creating a new paradigm, in which a toy reconstruction codebase is systematically built up piece-by-piece. Two versions exist, one using a lightweight (GlueX-style) datamodel, and the other using a Podio datamodel. Apart from the datamodel choice, the two versions are functionally identical. (Pull request #453)

- Improve debugging by having the JANA1-style JEvent::GetSingle directly throw a JException instead of a size_t, thereby producing a full stack trace (Pull request #461)

- Renamed JEventProcessor::Process(const JEvent&) to ProcessSequential to reduce user confusion (Note that this feature was experimental and unused up until now) (Pull request #456)

- JTopologyBuilder::connect() wires arrows using port id instead of port index, reducing confusion while manually configuring topologies. (Pull request #456)

- JFactoryT uses JDatabundle under the hood, as part of a deeper long-term refactoring. (Pull request #458, Issues #254, #276)

### 2.4.2

#### Behavior changes
- `jana:max_inflight_events` now defaults `nthreads` regardless of whether `nthreads` was explicitly set. Previously it defaulted to 4 when `nthreads` was unset, and otherwise defaulted to `nthreads`. (Issue #443)
- `JEventSource::GetEventCount()` is deprecated and replaced by `GetSkippedCount()`, `GetEmittedEventCount()`, and `GetProcessedEventCount()`. These behave intuitively when `nskip` is used. (Issue #428)

#### Features
- Added `jana:output_processed_event_numbers` parameter to assist with debugging (Issue #425)
- Ported `janaroot` plugin from JANA1
- JFactory detects and excepts on cycles (Issue #423)
- Improved scale test visualizations, including plotting multiple scaling tests on the same plot and supporting log scaled axes.

#### Bugfixes
- Missing template argument in VariadicPodioOutput
- JEvent was being marked as warmed up prematurely
- JAutoactivator was being called last instead of first (Issue #440)
- If the user attempted to run without providing a JEventSource, processing would crash with an ArithmeticException instead of a helpful error message (Issue #437)
- `JEventSource::FinishEvent()` was being called spuriously (Issue #424)

#### Refactoring
- Preliminary support for random-access JEventSources is provided via `JEventSource::Skip()`. This feature should be considered experimental for now because it doesn't work with barrier events yet. (Issue #422)

### 2.4.1

### 2.3.2
This release includes the following:

#### Features
- Added a simple `JWiringService` which can be used to wire `JOmniFactories` via a TOML file. (#353, #363)
- Added `add_jana_plugin`, `add_jana_library`, and `add_jana_test` CMake macros (#364)

#### Bugfixes
- A multithreading bug in `JEventProcessor` has been fixed.
- `JFactory::Create` now checks `JEventSource::GetObjects` (#361)
- `JPluginLoader` no longer loads plugins twice in certain cases (#343)
- `JParameterManager::FilterParameters` marks parameters as 'used', thereby avoiding spurious 'unused parameter' warnings. (#331)
- `JTypeInfo::to_string_with_si_prefix` generates the correct SI prefix in certain cases (#348)

#### Refactoring
- Plugins and their headers are now installed to a directory that doesn't conflict with a system install (#330)
- `JPluginLoader` has been extensively rewritten (#339)
- `JCsvWriter` has been moved into `examples` (#350)
- JANA's internal performance testing RNG has been refactored to be more reproducible, and to avoid ASAN violations. (#315)
- `JPodioExample` has been split into several reusable examples. (#352)
- Code was moved from `Omni` and `Status` into `Components`, making the layered architecture clearer (#351)
- Documentation has been overhauled, including adding an extensive JANA1-to-JANA2 migration guide (#334, #336, #342, #354, #357, #359)
- CI testing has been extended (#332, #341)

#### Behavior changes:
- JANA now has one internal logger, configurable via the `jana:loglevel` parameter. External loggers are now configurable via the `jana:global_loglevel` parameter.
- Log output has been streamlined: oversized tables are now YAML, and essential information is now logged at `WARN` level. (#362)
- `JPluginLoader` now stops when a plugin fails to load, rather than continuing searching for another plugin with the same name.
- `JPluginLoader` no longer accepts paths as part of a valid plugin name
- `JFactorySet` is no longer silent when the user attempts to include duplicates of the same factory (#343)
- `JMetadata` is deprecated, to be replaced with `JMultifactory`. (#345)
- All `JFactories` now call `JEventSource::GetObjects`, not just `JGetObjectsFactory`. (#361)
