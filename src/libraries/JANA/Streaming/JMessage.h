/// JMessage is an interface for data that can be streamed using JTransports.
///
/// The basic goal is to have an object wrapper around an old-fashioned `char*` buffer
/// which can be created automatically on either the stack or the heap. Most importantly,
/// it encapsulates the mess arising from variable message lengths. A common pattern
/// for solving this problem in C is to use flexible array members. Do NOT do this here,
/// as this causes a variety of problems when it comes to type safety and memory safety,
/// and it is not even part of any C++ standard. Instead, agree upon a max message size
/// (which your transport needs anyway), and declare an array of that length. The
/// array length (a.k.a. 'capacity') should be a compile-time constant, and the length
/// of the data contained (a.k.a. 'size') should be tracked in a separate variable.
///
/// In addition to the pure virtual methods listed below, conforming implementations need
/// a zero-argument constructor.
