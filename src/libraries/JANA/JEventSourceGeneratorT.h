class JApplication;

/// This templated class is used to generate JEventSource based objects
/// to handle reading events into JANA. Multiple JEventSourceGenerator
/// objects may exist in a given program, each representing a different
/// input type. For example, one source may be used to read raw data
/// while another may be used to read DST formats. A third may be used
/// to read from a network connection for online applications. For each
/// source specified in a given job, JANA will determine which JEventSource
/// class to use to read from it. It does this via the CheckOpenable method
/// of JEventSourceSourceGenerator.
///
/// A new instance of the JEventSource subclass will be created for each
/// input source in the job. For example, if two files of the same type,
/// are specified then the JEventSourceGenerator corresponding to that
/// file type will be used to create two JEventSource objects.
///
/// REQUIREMENTS OF JEventSource SUBCLASS:
/// --------------------------------------
///   - constructor that accepts (std::string, JApplication*)
///   - static std::string GetDescription(void) method
///
///
/// NOTE ON CheckOpenable:
/// --------------------------------------
/// 	This method should "peek" at the source to see if it is one that
/// 	it can open. It should return a value between 0 and 1 inclusive
/// 	with 0 meaning "cannot open" and 1 meaning "absolutely can open".
/// 	The check can be as simple as looking at the source name (e.g.
/// 	does it have a specific suffix) or more involved (e.g. opening
/// 	the file and checking for a magic header). Note that it should
/// 	not be assumed that the source represents a file name. It could
/// 	indicate a URL or how to connect to some other non-file source.
