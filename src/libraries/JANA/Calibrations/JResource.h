/// The JResource class is used to manage local resource files.
/// These would typically be larger files that are costly to download
/// every time the program is run. (i.e. if they come from the
/// JCalibration system.) Files are kept in a central location
/// on the local filesystem so only one copy needs to exist.
///
/// The JResource constructor takes two arguments. The first
/// is a pointer to a JCalibration object. If not NULL, this is used
/// to retrieve the URL of the file's location on the web. This allows
/// the JResource to automatically download the file if needed.
///
/// If no JCalibration object is supplied (i.e. it's NULL), then it will
/// simply look for a file with the specified namepath relative to the
/// root directory used to hold the resources. The root resource directory
/// can be specified multiple ways. These are, in order of precedence:
///
/// 1. Passed as second argument to the constructor
/// 2. Specified in JANA:RESOURCE_DIR configuration parameter
/// 3. Specified in JANA_RESOURCE_DIR environment variable
/// 4. Specified in JANA:RESOURCE_DEFAULT_PATH configuration parameter
/// 5. Create a user directory in /tmp called "resources"
///
/// Note that in nearly all instances, no second argument should
/// be passed to the constructor so that the value can be changed
/// via run time parameters.
///
/// Resource files can be of any format but if they are in an ASCII
/// format compatible with JCalibrationFile then the file can be
/// parsed using the Get(...) methods of JResource which map
/// directly to those of JCalibrationFile.
///
/// To get the location of a resource on the local file system,
/// use the method:
///
/// string GetResource(string namepath);
///
/// This will return a string with the full path to the resource file on
/// the local file system. The call will automatically download
/// the resource and install it if it does not already exist locally.
/// The download location will be retrieved using the specified
/// namepath and the JCalibration object passed in to the constructor.
/// The calibration DB should have an entry for the namepath that is
/// a map of key-values with two options for how the URL is specified:
///
/// Option 1.) The DB provides a "URL_base" string and a "path"
/// string. These are combined to make the full URL, and the
/// "path" is appended to the resource_dir to generate the local
/// path. Alternatively, "URL_base" may be provided via the
/// JANA:RESOURCE_URL configuration parameter in which case it need
/// not be present in the calib DB. If the config. parameter is
/// supplied, it will be used instead of any "URL_base" values found
/// in the calib DB.
///
/// Option 2.) The DB provides a "URL" string only. This is used
/// as the full URL and as a key to the resources map to find
/// the local path. If none exists, this local path is taken
/// to be the namepath specified (appended to resource_dir).
///
/// Option 1. takes precedent. If either the "URL_base" or "path"
/// strings are present, then the other must be as well or an
/// exception is thrown. If neither is present, then the URL
/// string is checked and used. If it also does not exist, an
/// exception is thrown.
///
///
/// A text file named "resources" is maintained at the top level of
/// the resources directory tree to record what URLs have been
/// downloaded and where the files are stored. This file is necessary
/// if option 2 above is used to store URLs in the calibration DB,
/// but is only informational if option 1 is used. It is ignored
/// completely if no calibration database is used.
///
/// The templated Get(namepath, T vals [, event_number]) method will
/// first call the GetResource() method described above, but will
/// then use a JCalibrationFile object to parse the resource file,
/// filling the container passed in for "vals". See the documentation
/// for the JCalibration class for more info on the allowed types
/// for "vals".
