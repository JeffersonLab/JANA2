PodioDatamodel
==============

This example shows how to define and integrate a PODIO data model within a JANA project.
The entire data model is defined within a single YAML file. The generated files can be found
in the build directory. The headers are installed to `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include/examples/PodioDatamodel` 
and the shared library is installed to `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib`.

This data model is used by `PodioExample`, `TimesliceExample`, and more.
